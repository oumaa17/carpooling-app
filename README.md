This Read Me provides an overview and instructions for the Carpooling Website built with Laravel. The Carpooling Website is a platform designed to connect drivers and passengers for sharing rides and reducing traffic congestion. It allows users to create and search for carpools based on their locations, destinations, and preferences.

This project was developed as our end-of-year project. We utilized HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and the Laravel framework to build the website. Additionally, we integrated the Google Maps JS API and Places API to enhance our project with interactive maps and location-based services.

Features
Our carpooling Website offers the following features:

User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and manage their profile information.

Create and Search Carpools: Users can create carpools by specifying their starting location, destination, date, time, and any additional preferences. They can also search for existing carpools based on their own requirements.

Join and Leave Carpools: Users can join available carpools as passengers or offer their vehicle as drivers. They can also leave a carpool if their plans change.

Ratings and Reviews: Users can rate and provide reviews for other participants in a carpool, helping build a reliable and trustworthy community.

Notifications: Users receive notifications for important events such as new carpool requests, accepted invitations, or updates to existing carpools.

Real-time Passenger Tracking: The website incorporates real-time tracking of passengers' locations, allowing drivers to monitor their progress.
